|===

In the Original Creditor section, you can view information about the
initial creditor.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|Creditor |Name of the original creditor.

|[#dan]####Account # a|
Account number of the creditor.

NOTE: Creditors must have a unique account number within a
link:creditor_groups.html[creditor group]. That is, if you already have
a creditor in a creditor group and this creditor has, for instance, the
account number 33211123356, then you are not allowed to add a new
creditor with the same account number to this group. In such a scenario,
an error message will appear in the top-right corner upon saving the
creditor profile, telling you that a creditor with the same account
number already exists. Such a validation is intended to check duplicates
within one creditor group only; creditors from different groups can have
duplicate account numbers. This rule, however, is ineffective when the
current link:users.html[user] has the Deals/Loans - Creditors - Add
Duplicate Account Number permission which allows saving duplicates.

|Original Balance |Initial debt amount at the moment of signing an
enrollment agreement.

|Current Balance |Current amount that has to be paid considering
payments that have not been made as of its due date.
|===

In the Current Creditor section, you can view information about the
current creditor. Such a creditor might appear, for example, if the
original creditor has sold the client debt to other parties.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|Creditor |Name of the current creditor.

|Account # a|
Account number of the creditor.

NOTE: Creditors must have a unique account number within the same
link:creditor_groups.html[creditor group]. That is, if you already have
a creditor in the creditor group and this creditor has, for instance,
the account number 33211123356, then you are not allowed to add a new
creditor with the same account number. In such a scenario, an error
message will appear in the top-right corner upon saving the creditor
profile, telling you that a creditor with the same account number
already exists. Such a validation is intended to check duplicates within
one creditor group only; creditors from different groups can have
duplicate account numbers. This rule, however, is ineffective when the
current link:users.html[user] has the Deals/Loans - Creditors - Add
Duplicate Account Number permission which allows saving duplicates.

|Current Balance |Current amount that has to be paid considering
payments that have not been made as of its due date.
|===

In the Override Address section, you can view information about the new
creditor address.
